# VBAScripts
Collection of useful VBA scripts. This could be useful during a pentest for a situation where you have remote desktop access to a pc with MS Office installed, but for whatever reason you can't open a command prompt or run any arbitrary code.

# Scripts

Execute a cmd command and return the output in message box.

### [ExecPython](https://github.com/joseph-dillon/VBAScripts/blob/master/ExecPython.bas)
